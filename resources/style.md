# Style Guide

## Overview

Summary of style formats for various aspects of RAPIDS projects.

### Intended audience

Community
{: .label .label-yellow}

Developers
{: .label .label-green}

## Code style

### Python

All Python code in RAPIDS projects is style checked using [`flake8`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)

Individual projects should configure `flake8` to suit their needs, for example to exclude specific directories or files.

## Git commits

Git commit messages should convey the change succinctly, but with enough detail to be understood without extra context.

See the [Git Methodology]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/resources/git/#git-commits) for further details.
