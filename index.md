# RAPIDS Community and Project Docs
{: .fs-9 }

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries enables end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. RAPIDS is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 open-source license and is intended to be built upon and hardened in the community. We need active contributors to help improve, support and build its future - so the links and resources on this page are here to help you develop on RAPIDS.
