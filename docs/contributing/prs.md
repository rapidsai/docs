## Create a pull request

Follow the steps [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to create a pull request for the correct repository.

Don't forget to verify the target branch. By default, this is the next release branch, but your issue may need to be merged into a different branch.

Follow the format below for the title and description.

## Format a pull request

### Title

Pull request titles should be succinct and state how the PR addresses the issue.

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Must start with `[WIP]` or `[REVIEW]`

`[WIP]` denotes a PR which is still being worked on and should never be merged. This is used to solicit feedback from the community.

`[REVIEW]` denotes a PR which the author believes fully addresses the issue and is ready to be reviewed and merged.

### Description

The description must start with `Closes #[issue number]`. If the PR [addresses multiple issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/#closing-multiple-issues), use an unordered and repeat `Closes #[issue number]` for each issue. For example:

```
- Closes #45
- Closes #60
```

The description should also detail the implementations, challenges, and solutions so reviewers can understand the approach. Liberally reference related pull requests or related issues, especially if this pull request may affect them.

The description should NOT reword the issue description.

### Comments

All comments and reviews to pull requests must follow the [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/resources/conduct/)

## Lifecycle

### Immediate

After opening the pull request, note the PR number and update the [changelog]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/resources/changelog) to reflect your changes.

### Merging

Once the pull request is ready, update the title to start with `[REVIEW]`.

All pull requests must pass continuous integration [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/). If your PR is failing CI but you believe the problem is unrelated to your code, please leave a comment in your PR to explain why.

Pull requests are reviewed by the community and once approved, the PR is merged by an approved reviewer.
