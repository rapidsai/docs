# Contributing
{:.no_toc}

RAPIDS can only grow with community support and it is vital to include developers at all levels. Reporting bugs, fixing them, and/or creating new features are all vital for the success of RAPIDS. The following pages outline our approach for contributing to RAPIDS.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting started

Welcome! We are excited you are here! Before you begin, we ask that everyone review the [Code of Conduct]({% link resources/conduct.md %}) before contributing.

### Your first issue

1. Read the project's README to learn how to setup the development environment
2. Find an issue to work on. The best way is to look for the <span class="label" style="background: #7057ff; color: #ffffff; text-transform: none">good first issue</span> or <span class="label" style="background: #008672; color: #ffffff; text-transform: none">help wanted</span> labels
3. Comment on the issue saying you are going to work on it
4. Code! Make sure to update unit tests!
5. When done, [create your pull request]({% link contributing/prs.md %})
6. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/). Fix if needed
7. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed
8. Once reviewed and approved, a RAPIDS developer will merge your pull request

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications!

### Seasoned developers

Once you have gotten your feet wet and are more comfortable with the code, follow these steps to find prioritized issues.

All RAPIDS projects have project boards for triaging [issues]({% link releases/triage.md %}) and planning [features]({% link releases/planning.md %}).

### More details

Review the [Code Contributions]({% link contributing/code.md %}) page.
