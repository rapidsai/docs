  Guide to Getting Started Using RAPIDS

# RAPIDS User Guides
{: .fs-8 }

The RAPIDS data science framework is a collection of libraries for running end-to-end data science pipelines completely on the GPU. The interaction is designed to have a familiar look and feel to working in Python, but utilizes optimized NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives and high-bandwidth GPU memory under the hood. Below are some links to help getting started with each of the individual RAPIDS libraries.
