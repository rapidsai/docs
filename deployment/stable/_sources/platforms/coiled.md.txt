# Coiled

You can deploy RAPIDS on a multi-node Dask cluster with GPUs using [Coiled](https://www.coiled.io/). By using the [`coiled`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/coiled) Python library, you can setup and manage Dask clusters with GPUs and RAPIDs on cloud computing environments such as GCP or AWS. Please visit Coiled's [getting started guide](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/getting_started.html) for setting up the service and the [GPU quickstart guide](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/gpu.html) to learn how to deploy and use Dask clusters with GPUs and RAPIDS.
