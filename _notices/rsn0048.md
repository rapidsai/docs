## Overview

RAPIDS is dropping all CUDA 11 support, including containers, all published packages (wheels and conda), and compilation from source in Release `v25.08`, scheduled for August 7, 2025. `v25.06` will be the last RAPIDS release to support CUDA 11 runtimes in any format. We are continuing support for CUDA 12.0 and 12.9 containers.

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v25.08` release, RAPIDS will cease distribution of CUDA 11 release artifacts, including containers and all our published packages (wheels and conda), and will not support compilation from source with CUDA 11.
RAPIDS will support CUDA 12.0 and 12.9 Docker containers.
Users who still wish to use CUDA 11 may pin to RAPIDS `v25.06`.
