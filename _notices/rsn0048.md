## Overview

RAPIDS is removing support for CUDA 11.8 Docker containers in Release `v25.08`, scheduled for August 7, 2025, and will cease publishing CUDA 11.8 Docker containers.
We are continuing support for CUDA 12.8 and 12.9 containers.

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v25.08` release, RAPIDS will cease distribution of CUDA 11.8 Docker containers.
RAPIDS will support CUDA 12.8 and 12.9 Docker containers.
Users who still wish to use CUDA 11.8 (or other versions in the CUDA 11.x or 12.x series) may continue to use RAPIDS via conda or pip.
