## Overview

Development effort has begun on supporting `CUDA 11.4` in `v21.08`. Support is currently experimental for `v21.08`. GA for `CUDA 11.4` is expected in `v21.10`

## Impact

Users are encouraged to use `CUDA 11.4` if possible and provide feedback to the RAPIDS libraries as we develop `v21.08`.
