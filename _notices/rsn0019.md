## Overview

`CentOS 8` is now at end-of-life, which means RAPIDS will no longer publish any images built on `CentOS 8` following the RAPIDS `v22.06` release.

Additionally, gpuCI CPU builds will be converted over to use `Rocky 8.6` instead of `CentOS 8`.

## Status

Dropping non-LTS support for `CentOS 8` will complete after RAPIDS `v22.08` release.

## Impact

Users should consider switching to any of the following container OSes for any `rapidsai/rapidsai-nightly` image:
  - Ubuntu 18.04
  - Ubuntu 20.04
  - Rocky 8.6
  - CentOS 7
