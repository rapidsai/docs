## Overview

Python 3.9 will be deprecated in our upcoming release of v22.12 scheduled for December 2022. After the v22.12 release, users should expect that support for Python 3.9 may be dropped at any point.


## Impact

Users should plan to move to a supported Python version as soon as possible. Support for Python 3.8 is being maintained, and support for Python 3.10 is being targeted for RAPIDS 23.02 (see [RSN 23](/notices/rsn0023)).
