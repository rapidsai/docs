## Overview

`Python 3.6` and `CUDA 10.0` have reached end of life (EOL) in RAPIDS `v0.14`
and will not be supported in the upcoming release of `v0.15`. This includes
`v0.15` nightly support which ended on 13-Jul-2020.

## Status

### Nightly support

- Has ended as of **13-Jul-2020**
  - No further `conda` packages or `docker` images will be released for these
  versions

### Documentation

- Updates to Docker Hub and NGC repos will be reflected with the `v0.15` release
- Updated [rapids.ai](https://rapids.ai/start#rapids-release-selector) release
selector to reflect EOL

## Rationale

### Python 3.6 EOL

Due to [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) support
for `Python 3.6` in a large number of our dependent libraries was removed in
late June 2020. Some libraries are continuing to publish `Python 3.6` packages;
however, others are working towards discontinuing them in the near future.

Given the push of the community to focus on `Python 3.7 & 3.8` we opted to spend
our resources on `Python 3.8` bring up for `v0.15`. See [RSN 3](/notices/rsn0003)
for updates.

### CUDA 10.0 EOL

Given community input and the release of `CUDA 11.0`, the team has opted to EOL
`CUDA 10.0` in favor of bring up for ***beta*** support of `CUDA 11.0` in
`v0.15`. See [RSN 4](/notices/rsn0004) for updates.

## Impact

Users should migrate to `Python 3.7` & `CUDA 10.1` our new defaults for RAPIDS.
