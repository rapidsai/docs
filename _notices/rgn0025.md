## Overview

`rmm` was hotfixed to version `v22.04.01`.

## Rationale

`rmm` was hotfixed to `v22.04.01` in order to fix a performance regression as noted in [#1024](https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm/pull/1024).

## Impact

All v22.04 users are encouraged to update the `rmm` library to `v22.04.01` as soon as possible.
