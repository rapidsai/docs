## Overview

RAPIDS is planning to deprecate support for its CUDA 11.2 Docker containers in Release `v23.12`, and to cease publishing CUDA 11.2 Docker containers in the `v24.02` release. `v23.12` will be the last version of RAPIDS to distribute CUDA 11.2 Docker containers. 

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v24.02` release, RAPIDS will cease distribution of CUDA 11.2 Docker containers. RAPIDS will continue to distribute CUDA 12.0 and 11.8 containers. Users who still wish to use CUDA 11.2 (or other versions in the CUDA 11.x or 12.x series) may continue to use RAPIDS via conda installation.
