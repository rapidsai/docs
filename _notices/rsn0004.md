## Overview

With the EOL of `CUDA 10.0` announced in [RSN 2](/notices/rsn0002), development effort has been redirected to support `CUDA 11.0` in `v0.15`. However, due to our dependency on `CuPy` we will only be able to offer support in `v0.15`.

`CuPy` has released `v7.8.0` with `CUDA 11.0` support. We have temporarily built a version of the `cupy` package in `rapidsai-nightly` [channel](https://anaconda.org/rapidsai-nightly/cupy/files?version=7.8.0) that has `CUDA 11.0` support. This is a stop-gap until `conda-forge` provides support for `CUDA 11.0`. Once support is on `conda-forge` we will remove our packages.

>**NOTE:** `v0.16` nightlies will continue to use our `v7.8.0` package for `CUDA 11.0` until an update is made on `conda-forge`
