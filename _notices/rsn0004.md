## Overview

With the EOL of `CUDA 10.0` announced in [RSN 2](/notices/rsn0002), development
effort has been redirected to support `CUDA 11.0` in `v0.15`.

`CuPy` has released `v7.8.0` with `CUDA 11.0` support. We have temporarily built
a version of the `cupy` package in `rapidsai` [channel](https://anaconda.org/rapidsai/cupy/files?version=7.8.0)
that has `CUDA 11.0` support. In addition we have temporarily built `faiss`,
`faiss-gpu`, `libfaiss` to support `CUDA 11.0` in the `rapidsai` [channel](https://anaconda.org/rapidsai/faiss/files?version=7.8.0).
These packages are a stop-gap until `conda-forge` provides support for
`CUDA 11.0`. Once packages are up on `conda-forge` we will remove our packages.

>**NOTE:** `v0.16` nightlies will continue to use our `v7.8.0` package for
`CUDA 11.0` until an update is made on `conda-forge`
