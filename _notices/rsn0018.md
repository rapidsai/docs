## Overview

Development effort will begin supporting `Rocky 8.6` in `v22.08` nightlies. `Rocky 8.6` will replace the `CentOS 8` OS distributions for future RAPIDS releases.  Support will be experimental for `v22.08` nightlies. GA support for `Rocky 8.6` is expected for `v22.08` stable.

## Impact

`CentOS 8` users are encouraged to migrate to `Rocky 8.6` if possible and provide feedback to the RAPIDS libraries as we develop `v22.08`.
