## Overview

`CUDA 10.1` & `10.2` will be deprecated in our upcoming release of `v0.19`
scheduled for April 2021. After the `v0.19` release, users should expect 
that support for `CUDA 10.X` may be dropped at any point.

## Impact

Users should plan to move to `CUDA 11.0+` as soon as possible. Future
support of additinal `CUDA 11.X` versions are being worked on for upcoming
releases. Further details will be shared in RSN notices as they become
available.
