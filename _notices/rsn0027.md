## Overview

`CUDA 11.0` will be deprecated in our upcoming release of `v22.06`
scheduled for June 2022. After the `v22.06` release, users should expect 
that support for `CUDA 11.0` may be dropped at any point.

## Impact

Users should plan to move to `CUDA 11.2+` as soon as possible. Future
support of additional `CUDA 11.X` versions are being worked on for upcoming
releases. Further details will be shared in RSN notices as they become
available.
