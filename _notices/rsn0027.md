## Overview

RAPIDS is deprecating `CUDA 11.4` and `CUDA 11.5` containers effective its `v23.04` release. RAPIDS will plan to EOL these containers in a future release (currently targeting `v23.06`), at which point `CUDA 11.4` and `CUDA 11.5` containers will no longer be published.


## Impact

Once these containers reach EOL (currently targeting `v23.06` release), RAPIDS will no longer publish these containers. Note that conda packages will still support `CUDA 11.4` and `CUDA 11.5` due to CUDA Enhanced Compatibility.
