## Overview

Ubuntu 18.04 will be deprecated in our upcoming release of v22.12 scheduled for December 2022. After the v22.12 release, users should expect that support for Ubuntu 18.04 may be dropped at any point.


## Impact

Users should consider switching to any of the following supported operating systems for any `rapidsai/rapidsai` image:
  - Ubuntu 20.04
  - Ubuntu 22.04 (support targeted for RAPIDS 23.02 -- see [RSN 25](/notices/rsn0025))
  - CentOS 7
  - Rocky Linux 8
