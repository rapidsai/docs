## Overview

`Python 3.7` has reached end of life (EOL) in RAPIDS `v22.02` and will
not be supported in the `v22.02` stable release nor the upcoming release of `v22.04`. This includes `v22.02`

- No further `conda` packages or `docker` images supported for `Python 3.7`
​
### Documentation
​

selector to reflect EOL changes and available install options
​
## Impact
