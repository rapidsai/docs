## Overview

RAPIDS is raising the minimum required CUDA version for the entire software suite from 12.0 to 12.2 starting with the v25.12 release.
All of RAPIDS will require a minimum of CUDA 12.2 including containers, all published packages (wheels and conda), and compilation from source in Release `v25.12`, scheduled for December 11, 2025.
`v25.10` will be the last RAPIDS release to support CUDA 12.0 and 12.1 runtimes in any format.
We are continuing support for CUDA 12 and 13 containers, with CUDA major version tags. See [RSN 53](https://docs.rapids.ai/notices/rsn0053/) for more information.

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v25.12` release, RAPIDS will require CUDA 12.2, including containers and all our published packages (wheels and conda), and will not support compilation from source with CUDA 12.0.
Users who still wish to use CUDA 12.0 may pin to RAPIDS `v25.10`.
