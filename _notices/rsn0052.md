## Overview

Starting with RAPIDS `v25.10`, RAPIDS libraries no longer depend on `pynvjitlink`.

The final release of `pynvjitlink` was `v0.7.0`. Future releases are not planned, and <https://github.com/rapidsai/pynvjitlink> will be archived.

## Impact

If you are only using `pynvjitlink` indirectly through RAPIDS libraries, no code changes are required.

The `pynvjitlink` library has been discontinued in favor of functionality in `cuda.core.experimental.Linker` ([docs](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-python/cuda-core/latest/generated/cuda.core.experimental.Linker.html)). Users of `numba-cuda>=0.16` can eliminate uses of `from pynvjitlink import patch_numba_linker; patch_numba_linker()`. The `numba.cuda` target will now automatically detect and enable nvjitlink when needed with no explicit configuration.

All other public APIs of `pynvjitlink` are replaced by `cuda.core` and `cuda.bindings` functionality.
