## Overview

RAPIDS team is planning to deprecate support for Pascal GPUs in its `v23.12` release and to remove support in its `v24.02` release. `v23.12` will be the last version of RAPIDS to support Pascal GPUs.

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v24.02` release, RAPIDS will no longer support Pascal GPUs. GPUs with Compute Capability 7.0 or higher will be required. The last release with support for Pascal GPUs is RAPIDS `v23.12`.
