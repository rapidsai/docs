## Overview

`cudf 23.10.01` introduced a bug that could cause incorrect output in `cudf` and `dask-cudf` when merging dataframes in which one of the indexes is not unique. `cudf` is being hotfixed to `23.10.02` to resolve this issue.

## Rationale

`cudf 23.10.01` introduced a bug that could cause incorrect output in `cudf` and `dask-cudf` when merging dataframes in which one of the indexes is not unique. `cudf` is being hotfixed to `23.10.02` to resolve this issue. The issue is not present in `cudf 23.12` nightlies.


## Impact

All `cudf` and `dask-cudf` users are encouraged to upgrade to the new `23.10.02` patch release.
