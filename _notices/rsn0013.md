## Overview

`Python 3.7` will be deprecated in our upcoming release of `v21.12`
scheduled for December 2021. After the `v21.12` release, users should expect 
that support for `Python 3.7` may be dropped at any point.

## Impact

Users should plan to move to `Python 3.8` as soon as possible. Future
support of additional `Python 3.9` version is being worked on for upcoming

releases. Further details will be shared in RSN notices as they become
available.
