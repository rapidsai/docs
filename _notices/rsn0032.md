## Overview

The RAPIDS cuSignal repository is integrating into the CuPy repository and will be deprecated in 3 to 4 months. We are tentatively targeting the v23.08 release scheduled for August 10, 2023 as the final release of RAPIDS cuSignal. After the v23.08 release, this repository will be archived during the v23.10 development cycle.


## Impact
Users should prepare to migrate to CuPy, which will include cuSignal functionality: https://github.com/cupy/cupy
