## Overview

Due to a bug in `glibc 2.31` (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1722181) with no current workaround, we are unable to publish `arm64` `ubuntu20.04` containers effective RAPIDS release `23.04`. `x86_64` containers are not affected. More details may be found in the tracking issue: https://github.com/rapidsai/docker/pull/551

## Impact

`arm64` users should migrate to `ubuntu22.04` as soon as possible.
