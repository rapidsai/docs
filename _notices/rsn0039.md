## Overview

RAPIDS is planning to deprecate support of CUDA 12.2 Docker containers in Release `v24.08`, and to cease publishing CUDA 12.2 Docker containers before the `v24.10` release.  The CUDA 12.2 containers will be replaced by CUDA 12.5 containers.  We are continuing support for CUDA 11.8 and 12.0 containers

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v24.08` release, RAPIDS will cease distribution of CUDA 12.2 Docker containers. RAPIDS will continue to support CUDA 11.8, 12.0 and 12.5 containers. Users who still wish to use CUDA 12.2 (or other versions in the CUDA 11.x or 12.x series) may continue to use RAPIDS via conda installation.
