## Overview

RAPIDS v22.10 was hotfixed to version v22.10.01 to update `cuda-python` and `cupy` dependencies.

## Rationale

`cuda-python` version requirement was updated to `>=11.7.1` to resolve errors on CPU-only machines or machines without CUDA installed. Additionally, the `cupy` dependency for pip packages was changed to `cupy-cuda11x` to resolve installation issues for some users.

## Impact

All users are recommended to use the latest `22.10.01` version of `rmm`, `cuDF`, `cuML`, `cuGraph`, and `cuGraph-ops`.
