## Overview

RAPIDS is removing support for CUDA 12.8 Docker containers in Release `v25.08`, and will cease publishing CUDA 12.8 Docker containers before the `v25.08` release.
The CUDA 12.8 containers will be replaced by CUDA 12.9 containers.  We are continuing support for CUDA 12.0 containers.

## Impact

Effective RAPIDS `v25.08` release, RAPIDS will cease distribution of CUDA 12.8 Docker containers.  RAPIDS will support CUDA 12.0 and 12.9 Docker containers.
Users who still wish to use CUDA 12.8 (or other versions in the CUDA 12.x series) may continue to use RAPIDS via conda or pip.
