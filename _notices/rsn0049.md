## Overview

**2025-07-01:** pypi.nvidia.com recovery is complete. All RAPIDS wheels have been restored to pypi.nvidia.com.

**2025-06-27:** NVIDIA's pip repo (pypi.nvidia.com) is down, impacting the ability for users to install RAPIDS via pip. The team is working to resolve this as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconvience this may have caused.

## Impact

Users will not be unable to download RAPIDS wheels for stable releases via `pip install`. Nightly releases, and other release channels (conda, docker) are not impacted.
