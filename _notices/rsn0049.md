## Overview

RAPIDS is aware pypi.nvidia.com is down and users are unable to insall PIP wheels via `pip install`, and working to get it back up ASAP.  We apologize for any invconvience this may have caused.

## Impact

Users will not be unable to download RAPIDS wheels for stable releases via `pip install`. Nightly releases, and other release channels (conda, docker) are not impacted.
