## Overview

The `cuml-cpu` package is being deprecated in favor of `cuml.accel`, cuML's new Zero Code Change Acceleration layer.
The final release of `cuml-cpu` will be version 25.04.
This change is part of RAPIDS' ongoing effort to provide more efficient and maintainable solutions for CPU acceleration.

## Impact

- The `cuml-cpu` package will be deprecated starting with RAPIDS 25.04
- The final release of `cuml-cpu` will be version 25.04
- Users are encouraged to migrate to `cuml.accel` for CPU acceleration
- No immediate action is required for users of `cuml-cpu`, but migration planning should begin

Users are encouraged to explore `cuml.accel` as their new solution for CPU acceleration.
