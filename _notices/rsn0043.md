## Overview

RAPIDS will move certain older conda packages in the `rapidsai` conda channel
under a new label: `legacy`. These packages will still be available by adding
`-c rapidsai/label/legacy` to installation and search commands.

By moving these packages out of the main portion of the channel, newer RAPIDS
conda environments will be solvable with `strict_channel_priority`, speeding up
environment solve times.

All RAPIDS conda install commands for RAPIDS versions `v23.04+` will continue to
work without any user intervention.

This change will occur concurrently with the release of RAPIDS `v25.04`.


## Impact

RAPIDS environments installed using `conda` or `mamba`, for environments older
than RAPIDS `v23.04` will fail to install unless `-c rapidsai/label/legacy` is
added to the installation command.

e.g. if you are creating an environment like:

```python
mamba create -n rapids-23.02 rapids=23.02 python=3.10 'cuda-version>=11.4,<=11.8' -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia
```

you will need to instead run

```python
mamba create -n rapids-23.02 rapids=23.02 python=3.10 'cuda-version>=11.4,<=11.8' -c rapidsai -c rapidsai/label/legacy -c conda-forge -c nvidia
```
