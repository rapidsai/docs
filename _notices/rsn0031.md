## Overview

RAPIDS packages that build pip wheels (rmm, cudf, raft, cuml, cugraph, cuopt, ucx-py) are now building pip wheels with CUDA 12 support. We plan to release these packages in release v23.06.

CUDA 12 wheels are named with a `-cu12` suffix to distinguish them from CUDA 11 wheels which have a `-cu11` suffix.


## Impact

Users should be aware we now are building pip wheels with CUDA 12 support as noted above.
