## Overview

With the deprecation of `CUDA 11.4` and `CUDA 11.5` announced in [RSN 27](https://docs.rapids.ai/notices/rsn0027), development effort has been redirected to support CUDA 12.0 in v23.06.

## Impact

Users are encouraged to use CUDA 12 if possible and provide feedback to the RAPIDS libraries as we develop v23.06
