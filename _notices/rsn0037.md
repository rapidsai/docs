## Overview

RAPIDS is deprecating `CentOS 7` in release v24.04, and it will be removed in release v24.06.  This is due to `CentOS 7` becoming end of life in June 2024, which means RAPIDS will no longer publish any images built on `CentOS 7` following the RAPIDS `v24.04` release.


## Impact

Users should consider switching to any of the following supported operating systems for any rapidsai/rapidsai image:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 
  - Ubuntu 20.04
  - Rocky 8
