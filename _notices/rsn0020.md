## Overview

We have recently become aware that `cuda-python` `11.7.1` has incorporated changes that makes it 
incompatible with current and legacy versions of RAPIDS when you try to install RAPIDS. You will 
need to pin `cuda-python` to `11.7.0` in conda during installation, and potentially after.  An 
affected installation with the `11.7.1` issue results in this error being thrown:
```

```


## Status

Currently, we have these two resolution paths to offer:

	Resolution Path 1: You can upgrade your RAPIDS version to `v22.06.01`.  
	- We've made it easy to upgrade: simply use our Release selector and install `v22.06` or rerun you `v22.06` installation script. It will automatically grab `v22.06.01` via Conda or Docker.
	
	Resolution Path 2: If you can NOT upgrade, pin `cuda-python` to `11.7.0` in RAPIDS `v22.02`, `v22.04`, and `v22.06`, 
	- You can pin `cuda-python` to `11.7.0` by using `cuda-python=11.7.0` when doing an install.  
	- Example command: `conda install -c nvidia cuda-python=11.7.0`.  

Older versions of RAPIDS may also be affected and users should attempt to upgrade or pin.

## Impact

This issue impacts users installing conda packages of RAPIDS 22.02 through 22.06, 
which depend on `cuda-python`. This issue also affects existing conda installations of 
RAPIDS versions 22.02 - 22.06 if the user installs additional packages depending on 
`cuda-python` that result in an update to `cuda-python>11.7.0`.
