## Overview

With the deprecation of `Python 3.9` announced in [RSN 22](/notices/rsn0022), development
effort has been redirected to support `Python 3.10` in `v23.02` nightly releases.

## Impact

Users are encouraged to test nightly `conda` and `docker` builds and report any
issues in their respective repos.
