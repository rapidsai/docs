## Overview

RAPIDS `21.12` packages will be built using the latest `11.5` version of `nvcc` and the CUDA runtime and distributed for use with any CUDA driver `>=450.80.02` via the use of CUDA Enhanced Compatibility. We strongly recommend using the CUDA `11.5` runtime. Any runtime `>=11.0` and `<11.5` is supported on a best-effort basis.

## Impact

One limitation this poses for users running older minor versions of the CUDA runtime is that the use of `debug=True` with the numba `@cuda.jit` decorator will result in a runtime error. Users running `11.5` will still be able to use `debug=True`.
