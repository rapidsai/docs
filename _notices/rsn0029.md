## Overview

Python 3.8 support will be dropped in the upcoming release of v23.06, scheduled for June 2023. Python 3.9 support will be added at the same time, so that v23.06 will support Python 3.9 and 3.10.


## Impact

Users should plan to move to a supported Python version 3.9 and/or 3.10 as soon as possible.
