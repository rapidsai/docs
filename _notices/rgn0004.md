## Overview

`cuxfilter` depends on Numba `v0.51`. Currently there is only `v0.51.0` there
are known issues with this release for other RAPIDS libraries and we need to
wait for `v0.51.1` to release `cuxfilter`.

## Status

- **26-Aug-2020** - Released RAPIDS `v0.15` without `cuxfilter`
- **08-Sept-2020** - Re-released RAPIDS `v0.15` with `cuxfilter`

## Impact

Users are encouraged to use the previous version of `cuxfilter` from `v0.15`
until this is resolved.
