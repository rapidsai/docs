## Overview

`cuxfilter` depends on Numba `v0.51`. Currently there is only `v0.51.0` there
are known issues with this release for other RAPIDS libraries and we need to
wait for `v0.51.1` to release `cuxfilter`.

## Status

- **26-Aug-2020** - Released RAPIDS `v0.15` without `cuxfilter`
- **On-going** - Test and release `cuxfilter` when Numba `v0.51.1` is released

## Impact

Users are encouraged to use the previous version of `cuxfilter` from `v0.15` until this is
resolved.
