## Overview

Starting with RAPIDS `v26.02`, `libcumlprims` conda packages will no longer be published and <https://github.com/rapidsai/cumlprims_mg> will be archived.

The final release of `libcumlprims` was `v25.12`.

## Impact

If you are not directly using `libcumlprims` or the `cumlprims_mg` source code, no impact is expected.

All of the functionality from that project has been moved into `cuml` (see <https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/pull/7585>).
