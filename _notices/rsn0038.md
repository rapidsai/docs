## Overview

Currently, most RAPIDS conda packages are published to the `rapidsai` channel except for `libcumlprims`, `libcugraphops`, and `pylibcugraphops`, which are published to the `nvidia` channel.
These packages will be moved to the `rapidsai` channel, to simplify the user experience and ensure that all RAPIDS packages are available from the same channel.

For the 24.06 release, `libcumlprims`, `libcugraphops`, and `pylibcugraphops` will be added to the `rapidsai` channel.
These packages will be available on both the `rapidsai` and `nvidia` channels for 24.06 and 24.08.
Starting in 24.10, the packages will only be available on the `rapidsai` channel.

RAPIDS users should continue to use the conda channel priority `-c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia` to ensure that packages are installed from the correct channel (this is unchanged).

## Impact

New installations of RAPIDS will be unaffected, as the `rapidsai` channel is already required for most RAPIDS packages.
Users updating `libcumlprims`, `libcugraphops`, and `pylibcugraphops` should be aware that the channel will change.
