## Overview

22.06 `devel` containers will be released on Wednesday 6/15/22. Conda packages and `base` container release dates will remain unchanged.

## Rationale

22.06 release artifacts will be bifurcated--conda packages and `base` containers (i.e. those other than `devel`) will be released on Wednesday 6/8/22. `devel` containers will be released on Wednesday 6/15/22.
