## Overview

[`rapidsai/dask-xgboost`](https://github.com/rapidsai/dask-xgboost) is
deprecated in `v0.15` and will be removed in `v0.16`. As of release 1.0, XGBoost
provides a native [Dask API](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dask.html).

The native XGBoost API has all of the functionality of dask-xgboost, combined
with an updated, clean API and much more extensive testing. All users are
encouraged to switch to the native API. See also this [blog post](https://medium.com/rapids-ai/a-new-official-dask-api-for-xgboost-e8b10f3d1eb7)
for an overview.

## Status

- Added a [deprecation warning](https://github.com/rapidsai/dask-xgboost/pull/4/files)
to the RAPIDS [`rapidsai/dask-xgboost`](https://github.com/rapidsai/dask-xgboost)
repo

## Impact

Any other projects or developers using our version of `rapidsai/dask-xgboost`
should switch to the upstream repo [dask/dask-xgboost](https://github.com/dask/dask-xgboost)
