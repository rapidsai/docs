## Overview

`CUDA 10.1` & `10.2` have reached end of life (EOL) in RAPIDS `v0.19` and will
not be supported in the upcoming release of `v0.20`. This includes `v0.20`
nightly support which ended on 2021-04-05.

## Status

### Release support - `v0.19`

- Final release of `conda` packages or `docker` images supporting `CUDA 10.X`

### Nightly support - `v0.20`

- No further `conda` packages or `docker` images supporting for `CUDA 10.X`

### Documentation

- Updates to Docker Hub and NGC repos will be reflected with the `v0.19` release
- Updated [rapids.ai](https://rapids.ai/start#rapids-release-selector) release
selector to reflect EOL changes and available install options

## Impact

Users should migrate to `CUDA 11.0` or `11.2` for RAPIDS.
