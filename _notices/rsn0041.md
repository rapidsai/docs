## Overview

RAPIDS will stop releasing cugraph-ops in 25.02, including the `libcugraphops` and `pylibcugraphops` package. The graph sampling code previously used by cugraph has been directly integrated into cugraph. The equivariant neural network primitives have been migrated to BioNeMo, with the front-end package now available as [cuEquivariance](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuEquivariance). The GNN aggregation primitives are also set to be relocated to a new destination soon.


## Impact

The GNN convolutional layers in the `cugraph_dgl.nn` and `cugraph_pyg.nn` modules will be temporarily removed. They will be reintroduced once the migration is complete.
