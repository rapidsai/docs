## Overview

RAPIDS will stop releasing `cugraph-ops` in 25.02, including the `libcugraphops` and `pylibcugraphops` packages. The graph sampling code previously used by cuGraph has been directly integrated into cuGraph. The equivariant neural network primitives have been migrated to BioNeMo, with the front-end package now available as [cuEquivariance](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuEquivariance). The GNN aggregation primitives will be relocated to a new destination soon.


## Impact

The GNN convolutional layers in the `cugraph_dgl.nn` and `cugraph_pyg.nn` modules will be temporarily removed. They will be reintroduced at a later time.
