## Overview

RAPIDS is planning GA support for `Ubuntu 22.04` in its `v23.02` release. `Ubuntu 22.04` will replace the `Ubuntu 18.04` OS distributions for future RAPIDS releases. Experimental support will begin in `v23.02` nightlies.

## Impact

`Ubuntu 18.04` users are encouraged to migrate to a supported version of Ubuntu as soon as possible.
