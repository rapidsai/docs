## Overview

RAPIDS is making a number of changes to its end-user Docker images to improve functionality, performance, and maintainability. These changes are targeted to be introduced in the RAPIDS 23.06 release.

While many of these changes should be seamless to users, **some of them are breaking**. Users should review the full list of changes in the associated issue https://github.com/rapidsai/docker/issues/539


## Impact

Users should be particularly aware of the breaking changes as noted above. In order to extend the transition time for impacted users, RAPIDS will continue to publish containers in the old namespace (i.e. rapidsai/rapidsai-core) for one additional release until 23.08.
