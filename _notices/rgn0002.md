## Overview

`clx` depends on PyTorch `v1.6` which does not have `CUDA 11.0` support
currently. The `v0.15` release of `clx` will only support `CUDA 10.1` &
`CUDA 10.2`.

## Status

- **26-Aug-2020** - Released `CUDA 10.1` and `CUDA 10.2` support for `clx`

## Impact

Users are encouraged to use nightly `conda` packages in `v0.16` when `CUDA 11`
support is available.
