## Overview

Ubuntu 16.04 is now at end-of-life, which means RAPIDS will no longer publish any images built on Ubuntu 16.04.

Additionally, gpuCI CPU builds will be converted over to use CentOS 7 instead of Ubuntu 16.04.

## Status

Dropping full support for Ubuntu 16.04 is an ongoing effort.

## Impact

Users should consider switching to any of the following supported operating systems for any `rapidsai/rapidsai` image:
  - Ubuntu 18.04
  - Ubuntu 20.04
  - CentOS 7
  - CentOS 8
