## Overview

RAPIDS will be migrating to a new branching strategy for the 25.08 release. The new 
strategy will use a single long-lived branch called `main`, which all pull requests 
should target. In preparation for a release, a release branch will be created from 
`main` and any remaining pull requests for that release should be merged into the
release branch.

Releases and hot fixes will be tagged from the release branch.

This new strategy will be piloted on several RAPIDS libraries (`rapidsai/rmm`, 
`rapidsai/kvikio`, and `rapidsai/cugraph-gnn`) during the `25.08` development cycle.
Migrations will begin shortly after the 25.06 release. After the `25.08` release,
the new strategy will be implemented across all RAPIDS libraries.

## Impact

Contributors should target the default `main` branch for all pull requests. During 
release preparation, pull requests may need to be re-targeted to the release branch.

External repositories that depend on RAPIDS shared workflows should be updated to use the 
`main` branch or new tags for each release. The RAPIDS team will work with external 
repositories to ensure a smooth transition.
