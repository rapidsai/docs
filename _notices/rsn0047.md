## Overview

RAPIDS will be migrating to a new branching strategy for the 25.08 release. The new
strategy will use a single long-lived branch called `main`, which all pull requests
should target. In preparation for a release, a release branch will be created from
`main` and any remaining pull requests for that release should be merged into the
release branch.

Releases and hot fixes will be tagged from the release branch.

This new strategy will be piloted on several RAPIDS libraries (`rapidsai/rmm`,
`rapidsai/kvikio`, and `rapidsai/cugraph-gnn`) during the `25.08` development cycle.
Migrations will begin shortly after the 25.06 release. After the `25.08` release,
the new strategy will be implemented across all RAPIDS libraries.

## Impact

Below is a table comparing the current and new branching strategies. Here, the current release is `YY.MM` (e.g. 25.06) and we denote the next release as `<YY.MM-next>` (e.g. 25.08).

Aspect | Current (25.06) | New Branching Strategy (25.08+)
-- | -- | --
Default Branch | Switched per release (e.g. `branch-YY.MM`, then `branch-<YY.MM-next>`) | Always `main` (latest and greatest)
Feature PRs | Target current default branch; retarget manually if moving to a different release | Always target `main`. During release preparation, pull requests may need to be re-targeted to the release branch.
Release Branching | No specific branch, `branch-YY.MM` is the release branch | Create `release/YY.MM` for releases, used during burndown & code freeze
Burndown Process | `branch-<YY.MM-next>` is created | Bump `main` to `<YY.MM-next>.00`, tag `v<YY.MM-next>.00a`, create branch `release/YY.MM`, enable forward merges from `release/YY.MM` → `main`
Code Freeze | Only admin-merges to `branch-YY.MM` | Only admin-merges to `release/YY.MM`
Release | Merge `branch/YY.MM` → `main`; tag `vYY.MM.00` on `main` | Merge `release/YY.MM` → `main`; disable forward-merges from `release/YY.MM` → `main`; tag `vYY.MM.00` on `release/YY.MM`
Hotfixes | Cherry-pick directly onto `branch-YY.MM`, follow release process | Create branch `hotfix/YY.MM` from pre-tag commit on `release/YY.MM`, open PRs to `release/YY.MM` and `main`, follow release process
Tooling | Ops-bot for forward-mergers, release scripts | Minimal custom tooling; leverage standard GitHub workflows

External repositories that depend on RAPIDS shared-workflows should be updated to use the `main` branch or new tags for each release. The RAPIDS team will work with external repositories to ensure a smooth transition.
