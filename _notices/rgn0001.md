## Overview

RAPIDS has decided to follow other Open Source projects in renaming their
"default" git branch to `main`. Starting with the `v0.15` release, the existing
RAPIDS stable/release branch will be removed and all references should use the
`main` branch going forward.

>**NOTE:** RAPIDS uses `branch-X.Y` as our GitHub default branch for
development; however, our stable/release branch is typically the "default"
branch for others and new git projects.

For more information read the [GitHub docs](https://github.com/github/renaming/)
detailing their plan for renaming branches.

## Status

### Updates

- **10-Jul-2020** - `main` branches were added to all repos with an existing
stable/release branch
- **15-Jul-2020** - Documentation with outdated references were updated with PRs
to `main`
- **Completed** - PRs to update scripts and other mentions will be merged into
`branch-0.15` and then into `main`
- **26-Aug-2020** - Release `v0.15` occurred and using the `main` branch
- **28-Aug-2020** - Renaming complete, old branches removed

## Impact

Any other projects or developers referring to our current stable/release branch
will no longer work or may redirect incorrectly. This includes search and web
links that link to GitHub.

From the [GitHub docs](https://github.com/github/renaming/) on renaming, there
will be some redirects in place; however, they will redirect to the GitHub
"default" branch which in our case means links to stable/release will redirect
to our development branch. This may cause some confusion, but we will do our
best to ensure the links are updated.

Users that find outdated links should open an issue in the repo they have been
found. For updates on this docs site or [rapids.ai](https://rapids.ai), file an
issue [here](https://github.com/rapidsai/docs/issues/new/choose).
