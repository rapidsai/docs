## Overview

The RAPIDS `v0.15` release date has been extended for 1 week to 26-Aug-2020 to
better support CUDA 11.

## Rationale

Core RAPIDS dependencies like `CuPy` and `Numba` are planning to release stable
or release candidate versions that support CUDA 11 on or around 19-Aug-2020.
Given their release dates are scheduled on the original release date for RAPIDS
`v0.15`, we are extending the release so we can ship with more stable
dependencies instead.

## Impact

`v0.15`
